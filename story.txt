There once was a boy named Jim. Jim had three older Brothers, Tom, Loyd, and
Jake. One day, the 4 brothers decided to go fishing in a nearbye lake. Before,
they left, Tom and Jake gathered their fishing gear while Jim and Loyd hoisted
a rowboat above their heads.

A scratching noise came from the underside of the boat, and Loyd craned his head
to the direction of the noise. He saw a small octopus clinging to the boat, the
scratching noise probably coming from it's beak rubbing on the wood. Thankfully,
Tom and Jake had just come down to the docks, loaded up with gear for their trip.
