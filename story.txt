There once was a boy named Jim. Jim had three older Brothers, Tom, Loyd, and
Jake. One day, the 4 brothers decided to go fishing in a nearby lake. Before,
they left, Tom and Jake gathered their fishing gear while Jim and Loyd hoisted
a rowboat above their heads.

A scratching noise came from the underside of the boat, and Loyd craned his head
to the direction of the noise. He saw a small octopus clinging to the boat, the
scratching noise probably coming from it's beak rubbing on the wood. Thankfully,
Tom and Jake had just come down to the docks, loaded up with gear for their trip.


Loyd called the two and said, "Could you guys get that octopus off the bottom of
the boat? We don't have a hand here." It seemed like a simple task that couldn't
possibly go wrong, so Tom and Jake approached the octopus without caution. When
Tom grabbed the octopus by its head and started pulling on it, the octopus began
to scream. Yes, it screamed. Not just any scream, but one of a 7 year old kid,
who's ipad was taken by his older sibling.
